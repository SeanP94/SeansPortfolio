# Portfolio Project
---
This project is going to be a mixture of a project blog/cover letter/Django practice(With HTMX).

I will showcase projects I have worked on, and discuss what I've built while at PIRCH .

Current TODO:
    - Build main page, to discuss projects completed at Pirch and about me.
    - Use HTMX for some kind of interactivity.
    - Maybe build some kind of web scrapper to see what I'm working on between multiple sites.

This is a build out from my DjangoHtmxTodo project, which was practice for working on this.
